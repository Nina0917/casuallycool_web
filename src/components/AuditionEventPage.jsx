                                    Auditions for the 2023-2024 Competition team will be held twice this year with a similar format for fall and
                                    winter. The fall audition will be Wednesday <span class="font-semibold">September 27th 8:30 to 10:30 pm at ARC Studio 4</span>, and the winter audition will
                                    be at the beginning of <span class="font-semibold">January</span>.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The audition design was crafted to be flexible and accommodate many situations. The in-person
                                    component, where the directors will teach a choreography ranging from 30 to 60 seconds, is the most heavily weighted part. However, the optional multi-video component
                                    allows an auditonee to submit videos even after the in-person deadline to maximise their potential and showcase their desires.
